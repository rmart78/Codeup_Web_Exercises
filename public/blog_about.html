		<h1>About Raul Martinez</h1>
		<img id="dictator_photo" src="/img/dictator.jpg" alt="picture of a dictator">
		<p>A native of San Antonio, Texas, few knew that one day Raul would rise to prominence in the world of front-end web development. Although fulfilled by his work, he found himself requiring a creative outlet through which he could voice his many, many opinions on a wide range of issues. Out of this yearning in his soul rose the Rock Salt blog, a place where Raul could tell it like it is without fear of reprisal or contradicting opinions.</p><p>Guest comments may be erased without notice.</p>
